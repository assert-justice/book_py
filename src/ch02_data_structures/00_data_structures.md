# Data Structures

In this chapter we'll go over two of Python's basic data structures as well as Python's concept of a for loop. So far we've been discussing primitive data types like integers and strings. We can store individual values in variables but once we learn to use these new tools the power and expressiveness of the programs we can write will expand drastically.
