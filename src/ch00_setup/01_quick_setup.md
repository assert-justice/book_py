# Quick Setup

Use an online IDE. For the library classes I'll be using [pycompile](https://pycompile.com/) but any you find should be fine.

> IDE, integrated development environment. Basically the program that you write code in and can run it from.

In the code window clear anything that is already there and type `print("hello world!")`. Click the "run code" button. In the console to the right you should see the text "hello world!". Congratulations! You've written and run your first Python program!
