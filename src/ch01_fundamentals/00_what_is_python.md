# What is Python

- high level
- dynamically typed
- interpreted
- interoperates well with c
- used in data science
- useful for writing scripts

High Level means Python abstracts away the hardware details and differences between operating systems, at least as well as it can. This is as opposed to low level languages like C and assembly. Those languages are more fiddly and require more specialized knowledge to write, in exchange for performance. Most popular languages in use now are high level.

Dynamically Typed means that when we get to variables, any variable can hold any type of value. This is like languages like Ruby and JavaScript, and unlike statically typed languages like C, C++, Java, C#, and so on. Dynamically typed languages are thought to be easier to write, but statically typed languages can make grantees and find issues before you even run your code.

Interpreted means there is a program on your computer, called an interpreter, that reads your Python scripts and follows what those scripts say to do. Imagine the interpreter as a little robot and our scripts as sets of instructions for that robot to execute. This is as opposed to compiled languages. With those, a program called a compiler takes the code you write and translates it into native machine code your computer can understand. Interpreted languages tend to be slower, that little robot has some overhead, but it lends itself to languages that are high level and portable.

Python interoperates well with C. We won't be touching these capabilities in this class, but you can call code written in C and C++ from Python relatively easily. This lends itself well to writing high level code that has good performance.

Python is often used in data science. It has extensive library support for collating, analyzing, and visualizing data.

For my purposes though, I use it for writing scripts. If I want to automate a complex task but don't want to write a whole dedicated program a few Python scripts are the way to go.
