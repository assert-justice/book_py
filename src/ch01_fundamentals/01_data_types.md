# Data Types

## Int

Integers, you may remember from a math class, are round numbers like 10, 42, a million, etc. They can also be negative. We will mostly be using integers for now. Integers are best for representing discrete values like how many people are in a room or how many streets a city has.

## Float

Float is short for floating point number, meaning a umber with a decimal point in it. Floats are used to represent real numbers and are best for continuous values like how many miles to a destination or how much gas isin your tank.

## String

Strings represent text like names, addresses, books, search results. You know, text. When we wrote and ran `print("hello world!")` the "hello world!" part was a string. Strings in your source code have quotation marks around them.

## Boolean

What is true? What is false? In python these are not mere philosophical questions. At the end of the day everything that goes on in your computer is high and low electrical signals representing ones and zeros, true and false. These are called Boolean values, named after a mathematician named George Bool. Think about bools like the answer to yes/no questions like "are you older than 18" and "will it rain today?". Unlike most other languages in Python True and False are capitalized like so.

## None

Finally that brings us to nothing. No really. Most programming languages have the concept of null or nil or nothing. This isn't zero and it's not false, those are valid values for integer and bool respectively. None is the absence of any value. It doesn't seem very useful does it? Well in a dynamic language like Python it's pretty much unavoidable.
